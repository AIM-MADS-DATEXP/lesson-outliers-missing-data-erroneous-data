The original file titanic.csv was downloaded from https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/

It was processed to add errors for the workshop in https://github.com/mcdejonge/workshop-data-preparation/ (see https://github.com/mcdejonge/workshop-data-preparation/blob/main/data/generate_data.ipynb for info on what was done).

Duplicates were then removed as they were irrelevant for this specific lesson.
